                    <p>New York City Council governs nearly every policy-related aspect of a given New Yorker’s life. Given the city’s diversity and density, the number of New Yorkers who pay attention to the elected officials who represent them in the city’s chamber is much smaller than it should be.</p> 

                    On Sept. 26, 2024, New York City Mayor Eric Adams was charged with bribery and campaign finance offenses. The indictment brought a new light to New York City leadership and its possible scale of corruption, and the City Council members who spoke out against their elected leader received more attention than usual.</p>

                    Across the city, the question of who city leaders were and how they ended up in control of city policy spread.</p>

                    The last time all 52 City Council seats were up for reelection was in 2023. Redistricting to reflect 2020 census population changes forced a new slate of votes, but only 12.8% of New Yorkers turned out to vote for city council members in the general election.</p> 

                    Raine Johnson, the Executive Assistant to New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. She’s officially worked in city politics since 2018, and had previously been a volunteer for Comptroller Lander’s City Council campaign.</p>

                    From her close involvement with council members and longstanding connection to the world of city politics, she credits the lack of involvement from New Yorkers with their local electeds to a misunderstanding of the city council’s power. She believes that local politics is not taught at a lower school level as it should be.</p>

                    In New York City especially, where district lines and subsequent local leadership can start to define a New Yorker’s life through elementary, middle and high school applications, the importance of understanding the people who govern the city from a young age is even more pressing, she said.</p>
                    
                    The City Council is the legislative branch of the city’s government, and wields significant influence over local laws, budget decisions and oversight of city agencies.</p>

                    Each council member has the power to propose legislation, allocate funding for community projects and address constituents' concerns. While the council as a whole passes laws and approves the city budget, individual members often focus on issues unique to their districts.</p> 

                    Much like any local government, the City Council is NYC’s very own Congress. While the mayor has executive authority, the council can override a mayoral veto with a two-thirds vote.</p>

                    In its early years, the council was dominated by political machines, but eventually underwent reforms in the 20th century that increased transparency and accountability, reflecting a broader push for good governance.</p>

                    The late 20th century saw a period of reforms that allowed for more public involvement in council processes, like open council hearings and two-year term limits that put a check on council members’ power.</p>

                    Maximum New York, a civics academy focused on NYC’s governmental mechanics, was founded in 2019 to educate people on the inner workings of NYC politics.</p>

                    Maximum’s founder, Daniel Golliher, started MNY because he wanted to understand the structure of NYC’s government. Now, he’s running an organization that trains equally curious individuals to be experts in city government and politics, according to MNY’s website.</p>

                    Their team created a dataset to analyze the makeup of city council members.</p>

                    For each member since 1998 and a few from before then, it lists their name, district, borough, political party, date of birth, undergraduate/graduate universities and fields of study, whether they ever served on a community board, prior employer and more.</p>

                    The dataset sought to offer easily accessible information that would help New Yorkers understand whether the people who represented their best interests were fit to do so.</p>

                    Out of the 201 council members MNY reviewed, the top three professions from which council members came from before being elected were government, education and legal services. Ninety city council members, around 45% of the total assessed, had previously worked in government before running for office. Of that 45%, 13.9% had worked directly for a city council member before seeking their own seat in the chamber.</p>

                    <p>MNY was not able to find the data for 46 of the council members’ undergraduate field of study. However, for who they were able to find, the highest number of council members for a given major was for the 46 who studied political science. There were nine council members who had not attended an undergraduate institution prior to their election.</p>

                    From their research, MNY found that 34.33% of former city council members had served on community boards. In NYC, a community board is a local advisory group of 50 unpaid members that represent the city’s 59 districts. While they lack legislative power, their input often influences decisions that shape neighborhoods.</p>

                    <p>Since 1998, there have been 18 republicans to serve in the city council, approximately 8.96% of the total 201 council members to serve since then.</p>

                    <p>While MNY’s data and research into city council members does not represent each person’s background and research in full, Johnson thinks the group’s mission to deliver education on NYC’s government to more New Yorkers is essential to a well functioning city.</p>

                    <p>“Mayor Adams’ indictment was a reminder that focusing on transparency, understanding and education are the only ways to avoid a corrupt city,” she said.</p>
